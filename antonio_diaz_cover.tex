        Software developer currently focused on Rust, with 5+ years of experience {\mbox{primarily}} on frontend using TypeScript (React/Angular) and on backend with NodeJS and Python (Django).\\

        On 2015 I developed Critik, an online platform for literary enthusiasts created for Eidos Editorial, migrating {\sc{rdf}} data from a Virtuoso server using {\sc{sparql}} into our own {\sc{m}}y{\sc{sql}} database. Since then, I have been working on multiple platforms, as the online shop based in Los Angeles \href{https://www.thrivemarket.com}{\textit{Thrive Market}} or the site for the design studio \href{https://linii.group}{\textit{Linii}}, among others.\\

        My education is related to art and design, focusing my attention on art and digital technologies. I worked as designer and editor on the contemporary art magazine \href{https://www.revistasculturales.com/revistas/119/art-notes/numeros/}{\textit{\mbox{Art Notes}}} and with several institutions as project coordinator, as \href{https://cgac.xunta.gal/}{\sc{cgac}} or Medialab-Prado —currently \href{https://www.medialab-matadero.es/}{\it{Matadero-Medialab}}—. On 2012 I co-founded \href{https://www.antoniodiaz.me/diazpons-catalog-2016.pdf}{\it{\mbox{Díaz \& Pons}}}, a publishing house focused on digital and printed editions of non-fiction, where we edited high quality non-fiction books on art and social sciences.\\

        As a former publisher, I focus on readable and well-structured code, but also on methodologies that allow fluent and flexible procedures with complex teams while maintaining on-time delivery. In this regard I am currently interested on strongly typed languages such as Rust and design approaches that involve technical and non-technical members of the team such as Domain Driven Design.\\

        I am also interested in history of art and typography as well as robotics applied to R/C sailplanes.\\
