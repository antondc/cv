    Dear Sir or Madam,\\

            My name is Antonio Díaz. I am a web developer with three years of experience working with React, Node and Python, living and working in Moscow.\\

            My studies are related to art and design, focusing my attention on art and digital technologies. I worked as designer and junior editor about contemporary art on \href{http://www.revistasculturales.com/revistas/119/art-notes/numeros/}{\textit{Art Notes}}, and also worked with several institutions as project coordinator, as the \href{http://cgac.xunta.gal/}{Centro Gallego de Arte Contemporáneo —{\sc{cgac}}}—, \href{http://www.medialab-prado.es}{Medialab-Prado} or \href{http://www.benveniste.com}{Benveniste Contemporary}. On 2012 I co-founded \href{https://diazpons.antoniodiaz.me/}{Díaz \& Pons}, a publishing house focused on digital and printed editions of non-fiction.\\

            On 2015 I started working as developer, conceiving \href{http://critik.antoniodiaz.me}{\textit{Critik}}, a platform for literary enthusiasts developed for Eidos Editorial. Since then I have been working on multiple projects, as the website for the design studio \href{https://linii.group}{\textit{Linii}}, the educational platform \href{https://u.university}{\textit{Universal University}},  the site for the exhibition at the Jewish Museum \href{http://impossibleisinevitable.com/en/}{\textit{Impossible Inevitable}} or the site for the brewing company \href{http://mosbrew.ru/}{\textit{Mosbrew}}.\\

            Currently I specialize in React + Redux and Node.js development, creating custom CMS and
            management panels depending on the needs of each project. I also have other skills that are very useful, if not essential: experience in
            project planning and management, a sense of visual communication, capacity of fast learning, the understanding of the importance of customers relations and, last but not least, a strong will to succeed.\\

           If you consider the possibility of an interview please do not hesitate to contact me. Also you will find me at my website {\href{https://antoniodiaz.me}{\textit{www.antoniodiaz.me}}}, in my {\href{https://github.com/antoniodcorrea}{\textit{Github}}} account or in my telephone number: +7 (925) 866-73-09.\\\\

            Sincerely\\

            Antonio Díaz
